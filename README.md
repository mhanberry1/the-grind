# the grind

This is a game that I made with my friends for the Global Game Jam during freshman year of college.
We'd only been coding for a few months at this point, so it's unfinished and pretty rough around the edges, but it was a ton of fun to make!

You can play it [here](https://mhanberry1.github.io/the-grind/)

# story

The game jam's theme was "ritual." We decided to make a game about a "ritual" that most gamers are familiar with... grinding.

The game opens with a boss-fight, and you can't even do damage to him. As you retreat, he taunts you saying "You'll have to grind some more if you want to face me!"

So first, you have to upgrade your weapons. There is a grindstone in town, so you decide to use it to sharpen your sword. This sets the stage for a sword-sharpening mini-game.

This takes ages, and when you finally finish, so much time has passed that your medieval surroundings have given way to a modern-day city!

Well, we can deal with that later. For now, let's focus on buying more gear!

There are shops all around you, but nobody wants to take your money... A stranger informs you that if you want money, you'll have to get a job. Luckily, his coffee shop is hiring, and he'd be happy to give you some work.

Another mini-game is up next where you're grinding coffee for incoming customers. Once again, ages pass and by the time you're done, you find yourself in a futuristic cyberpunk dystopia.

Weird, but you can't let this sway your course! Now you've got to upgrade your mana. After asking around, you find a guy who says he has a potion that will maximize your mana, but you'll have to out-party him to get it.

So you follow them to a night-club where you get to play a DDR-syle minigame. When you've finally beaten him, he gives you a redbull. You chug it and promptly sprout glorious wings.

This is it! You're finally ready to take on the boss! You fly in to his cave and light a torch to find...

...

A skeleton. The boss died of old age many years ago.

**Congratulations.**
